Smart Parking System
Overview
The Smart Parking System is designed to address the growing challenges of traffic congestion, pollution, and time management in urban areas. This project leverages machine learning and smart technologies to create an efficient parking management system that reduces the hassle of finding parking spaces in busy environments like malls, hospitals, institutions, and other large sectors.

Features
Real-Time Vehicle Detection: A machine learning model is used to detect vehicles and issue tokens for parking, ensuring accurate tracking.
Smart Parking App: The app displays available parking spaces, allowing users to view and book slots near their destination in real-time.
Automated Entry & Exit: Cameras installed at entry and exit points automatically count vehicles using push and pop methods, updating the parking availability without the need for human intervention.
Real-Time Updates: The system continuously updates the number of available parking spots, ensuring users have the latest information at their fingertips.
Benefits
Reduces Traffic Congestion: By directing drivers to available parking spaces, the system helps reduce the time spent searching for parking, thereby decreasing traffic congestion.
Decreases Pollution: Less time spent driving around in search of parking results in lower vehicle emissions.
Saves Time: Users can book parking spots in advance, avoiding the frustration of arriving at a full parking lot.
How It Works
Smart Parking App: Users can access the app to check for available parking spots near their destination.
Booking: Users can reserve a parking spot through the app, ensuring a spot is available upon arrival.
Automated Tracking: Cameras at the parking facility automatically count the number of vehicles entering and exiting. The system updates the app in real-time with the current availability of parking spots.
Effortless Parking: Upon arriving, users can park in their reserved spot without the need for human assistance, and the system will automatically update the availability.
Conclusion
The Smart Parking System is a step forward in making urban parking more efficient and user-friendly. It helps users save time, reduces environmental impact, and eases the stress of finding parking in busy areas.
